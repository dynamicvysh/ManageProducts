# ManageProducts



How to run the api project
----------------------------------
1. Open the solution in visual studio (preferably 2017).
2. Run ManageProducts project.
3. It opens http://localhost:<port> in the browser. Append '/swagger/ui/index' to the url so that new url looks like http://localhost:<port>/swagger/ui/index
4. Now you can see all the implemented apis.

Note
-----------------------------------
You can add the products you wanted to load in csv file 'ManageProducts/ProductData/products.csv'.
Currently I have loaded 3 products with id 1, 2 and 3.


How to run the test project
-----------------------------------
1. Go to Test > Windows > Test Explorer in visual studio and test explorer opens
2. You will be able to see all the test methods in the test explorer, if not try rebuilding the 'ManageProductsTest' project
2. Click on run all option in the test explorer, and it should run all the test methods.
